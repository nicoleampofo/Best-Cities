<h1>Boston</h1>
<p>Boston should be on everyone's list of cities to visit in the United States of America. As a Boston resident, I like to think that if the colonists had not landed in Virginia first, Boston would be this country's capital. There are many historical and leisurly sites to visit</p>

<h2>The Prudential Center</h2>
  <p>The top of the Prudential Center is an amazing way to view the entire city. It is one of Boston's tallest buildings and is open to the public. As of 2018, tickets are $15 for students. Even in the rain, the sight will "wow" you, and you'll probably have one of the pictures you took as your phone's lock screen.</p>

<h2>Boston Public Market</h2>
  <p>On warm days, it seems like the entire city--visitors and locals--have come to the Boston Public Market. The indoor market has fresh apple cider donuts, flowers, wine, and cheeses. The open air market has produce as far as the eye can see. Come grab a meal and people-watch.</p>

<h2>The North End</h2>
  <p>Boston's Italian neighborhood has so many authentic Italian dishes that a visit will make you overwhelmed with all of the options. Pizza, pasta, and pastry shops run as far as the eye can see. Turn the corner, and there are even more restaurants and cafes. Come for a bite to eat in the North End!</p>
